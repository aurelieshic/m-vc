In this folder, you will find images, videos, zips,etc... in fact, all files wich are related to datas and not to structure.

NEVER PUT SOMETHING HERE MANUALY!!! It could be deleted if there is no relationship with datas. If you need a place to put a public file, put it in app/ folder.

Typically you will find here chached files like files downloaded from an other website or files linked to your database.
So, this folder, subfolders and files should be writable by php (777 mode probably...).
